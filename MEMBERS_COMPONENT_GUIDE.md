  "joinedDate": "2024-01-15"
}
```

### Member Data Structure

```typescript
interface Member {
  id?: string;           // Auto-generated by Firestore
  name: string;          // Full name
  email: string;         // Email address

## Component Methods

## Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: 3-4 cards per row (based on screen width)
- **Tablet**: 2 cards per row
- **Mobile**: 1 card per row (full width)

## Navigation

```html
<a href="/members" class="action-card">
  <div class="action-icon">ðŸ‘¥</div>
  <h4>View Members</h4>
  <p>Manage your team members</p>
</a>
```

## Firestore Integration

The component uses `FirestoreService` to:
- Fetch members collection reactively
- Display real-time updates
- Handle empty states

// Sample members include:
- Sarah Johnson (Admin, Active)
- Michael Chen (Manager, Active)

- David Kim (Member, Pending)
- Jessica Williams (Manager, Active)
- Robert Taylor (Member, Inactive)
```

## Design Inspiration

The card design follows modern UI principles similar to budget tracking apps:
- Clean white cards on light background
- Gradient accents for visual hierarchy
- Icon-based information display
- Color-coded status indicators
- Professional typography
- Subtle shadows for depth

## Performance

- Lazy loading with route-based code splitting
- Efficient RxJS observable streams
- CSS animations for smooth interactions
- Optimized bundle size

## Future Enhancements
