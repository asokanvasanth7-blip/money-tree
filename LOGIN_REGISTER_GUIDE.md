# Firebase Login and Register Implementation

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

Your Angular Money Tree application now has a complete Firebase Authentication system with:

### 1. **Login Component** (`/login`)
- Email and password authentication
- Form validation
- Error handling for various auth errors
- Loading states during authentication
- Link to register page
- Beautiful gradient UI design

### 2. **Register Component** (`/register`)
- User registration with email and password
- Password confirmation validation
- Minimum password length check (6 characters)
- Error handling for duplicate emails and weak passwords
- Link to login page
- Matching UI design

### 3. **Home Component** (`/`)
- Protected route (requires authentication)
- Displays logged-in user's email
- Logout functionality
- Welcome message and feature list

### 4. **Auth Guard**
- Protects routes that require authentication
- Automatically redirects to login if user is not authenticated
- Uses RxJS observables for reactive auth state management

### 5. **Auth Service**
- Complete authentication service with:
  - `signUp(email, password)` - Register new users
  - `signIn(email, password)` - Login existing users
  - `logout()` - Sign out users
  - `getCurrentUser()` - Get current user
  - `user$` - Observable for auth state changes

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start the Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

### Testing the Authentication Flow

1. **First Time Users:**
   - You'll be redirected to `/login` (since you're not authenticated)
   - Click "Register here" to go to the register page
   - Enter your email and password (min 6 characters)
   - Confirm your password
   - Click "Register"
   - You'll be automatically logged in and redirected to the home page

2. **Existing Users:**
   - Go to `/login`
   - Enter your email and password
   - Click "Login"
   - You'll be redirected to the home page

3. **Logout:**
   - Click the "Logout" button in the header
   - You'll be redirected to the login page

## 🔐 Firebase Console Setup Required

Before testing, make sure you've enabled authentication in Firebase Console:

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project: **moneytree-3f0eb**
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
4. Click on **Email/Password**
5. Enable the **Email/Password** provider
6. Click **Save**

## 🔄 Authentication Flow

```
User visits app
    ↓
Auth Guard checks if user is logged in
    ↓
Not logged in → Redirect to /login
    ↓
User can login or register
    ↓
After successful auth → Redirect to home page (/)
    ↓
User can access protected routes
    ↓
User clicks logout → Redirect to /login
```

## 🛠️ Error Handling

The implementation handles all common Firebase auth errors:
- Invalid email format
- Wrong password
- User not found
- Email already in use
- Weak password
- User disabled
- Network errors

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console** (required!)
2. Start your dev server: `npm start`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`
4. Test registration and login
5. Build additional features using the authenticated user data

## 💡 Tips

- The auth state is reactive using RxJS observables
- User data persists across page refreshes (Firebase handles this)
- You can access the current user anywhere by injecting `AuthService`
- The auth guard can be applied to any route that needs protection

**Your Firebase login and register system is now fully functional and ready to use!** 🎉
